This project is a simple Java-based Waste Collection Management System developed as 
a beginner-level console application.

Overview:

The main purpose of the system is to track daily waste collection activities by 
maintaining counts of houses where waste was successfully collected, houses that
were missed, and the number of complaints received. After execution, the program 
displays a summary report in the console showing the total collected,
missed, and complaint records.

This project demonstrates basic Java concepts such as variables, conditional statements,
counters, and console output formatting. It is designed to provide a clear understanding 
of how simple logic-based monitoring systems can be implemented using core Java.
